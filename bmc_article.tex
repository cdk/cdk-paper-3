\begin{abstract}
% Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
\paragraph*{Background:}
Cheminformatics is a well-established field with many applications in chemistry,
drug discovery, and the life sciences. Particularly in the latter field, however,
molecular properties are not well-understood yet, and the interaction between
molecules and larger systems remains a challenge to be modeled. Therefore, the
development of new data mining and pattern recognition continues to be important
and the need for access to a cheminformatics library that one can change remains.
\paragraph*{Results:}
We here report the 1.4 series of the Chemistry Development Kit and outline how
it evolved since the previous report. We demonstrate the new APIs we introduced
in this version and discuss the extensive quality control mechanism we have
adopted. New APIs have been introduced for substructure searching, rendering of
molecules, handling of molecular formulas, atom type perception, and InChI
support. At a quality control side we have introduced automated building,
extensive unit and use case testing, and adopted peer review.
\paragraph*{Conclusions:}
With this paper we have shown the continued effort to provide a free, Open Source
cheminformatics library, and show that such colleborative projects can survive for
a long period. We have taken advantage from the community support, and show
that an open source cheminformatics project can act as a peer reviewed
publishing platform for scientific computating software.

\section*{Results and Discussion}

\subsection*{New APIs}

Everyone is invited to contribute and write up the functionality they contributed;
only requirement: the code must have been incorporated into the main CDK library by the
time of submission of this paper.

  \subsubsection*{Atom Typing}
  
  The CDK has adopted a new atom typing algorithm \ldots (EGON)

  \subsubsection*{Rendering API}
  
  Initiated by ...
  
  \subsubsection*{Molecular Formula}

The chemical formula is the basic/simple chemical representation of a compound. It defines the number of atoms/isotopes and type of elements that constitute a chemical compound without describing how atoms are bonded.
It is also the first step toward the identification of the chemical structure from a unidentified compound.

CDK can handle several concepts related to chemical formulas
\begin{itemize}
\item Chemical formula =
\item Set of chemical formulas =
\item Range of chemical formulas =
\item Adducts =
\item Isotope Container =
\item Isotopic pattern = 
\item Rules = Filters in accepting an chemical formula
\end{itemize}

CDK can
\begin{itemize}
\item generate/print the elemental composition from a given IAtomContainer
\item calculate the isotopic pattern from a given chemical formula
\item determine the elemental composition from a given mass
\item validate a chemical formula
\item calculate the exact mass from a given chemical formula
\end{itemize}

Where can it be applied?

  \subsubsection*{SMARTS parser}
  
  ....

  \subsubsection*{Partial charges and Delocalization}
  
Partial atomic charges is an electronic property of atoms defining the asymmetric distribution of electrons in chemical bonds.
It is used as a quantitative correlation with certain compound's physical and chemical properties.

CDK can
\begin{itemize}
\item generate all resonance structures from a given compound 
\item calculate the topological and electronic weight value of each of the resonance structures
\item calculate the partial atomic charge from a given structure 
\end{itemize}

Where can it be applied?

  \subsubsection*{New Builders}
  
  ....

  \subsubsection*{InChI integration}
  
  .... jni-inchi dep, atom numbering, tautomer generation
  
\subsection*{Improved Coding Standards}

  \subsubsection*{Peer review}

  \subsubsection*{Modularization}

  \subsubsection*{Documentation}

  Initially done with DocCheck, replaced by OpenJavaDocCheck ...
  
  \subsubsection*{Unit testing}
  
  \subsubsection*{Code Quality}

  PMD ...

  \subsubsection*{Git, branching, and patches}
