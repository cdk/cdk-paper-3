\begin{abstract}
% Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
\paragraph*{Background:}
Cheminformatics is a well-established field with many applications in chemistry,
drug discovery, and the life sciences. Particularly in the latter field, however,
molecular properties are not well-understood yet, and the interaction between
molecules and larger systems remains a challenge to be modeled. Therefore, the
development of new data mining and pattern recognition continues to be important
and the need for access to a cheminformatics library that one can change remains.
\paragraph*{Results:}
We here report the 1.4 series of the Chemistry Development Kit and outline how
it evolved since the previous report. We demonstrate the new APIs we introduced
in this version and discuss the extensive quality control mechanism we have
adopted. New APIs have been introduced for substructure searching, rendering of
molecules, handling of molecular formulas, atom type perception, and InChI
support. At a quality control side we have introduced automated building,
extensive unit and use case testing, and adopted peer review.
\paragraph*{Conclusions:}
With this paper we have shown the continued effort to provide a free, Open Source
cheminformatics library, and show that such colleborative projects can survive for
a long period. We have taken advantage from the community support, and show
that an open source cheminformatics project can act as a peer reviewed
publishing platform for scientific computating software.
